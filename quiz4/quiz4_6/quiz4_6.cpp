/*
Question #4

Write a program that asks for the name and age of two people, then prints which person is older.

Here is the sample output from one run of the program:

Enter the name of person #1: John Bacon
Enter the age of John Bacon: 37
Enter the name of person #2: David Jenkins
Enter the age of David Jenkins: 44
David Jenkins (age 44) is older than John Bacon (age 37).

Hint: Input the personâ€™s name using std::getline()

//The std::ws discards any whitespaces that follows after std::cin.
//if there is 37 in the cin, its not just 37. Its 37 and an enter since we have to press enter.
